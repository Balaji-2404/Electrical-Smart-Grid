## Intelligent Energy Management across Smart Grids Deploying 6G IoT, AI, and Blockchain in Sustainable Smart Cities
This paper presents an innovative framework for enhancing energy management in smart grids within sustainable smart cities by integrating advanced technologies such as 6G IoT, AI, and blockchain. It utilizes a suite of machine learning models including decision trees, XGBoost, support vector machines, and optimally tuned artificial neural networks to predict grid load fluctuations, especially during peak demand, thereby ensuring consistent power delivery and preventing overloads. Additionally, the framework employs LSTM recurrent neural networks to analyze weather data for accurate solar energy production forecasts, which aids in better energy consumption planning. For microgrid management within individual buildings or clusters, deep Q reinforcement learning is applied to dynamically manage and optimize photovoltaic energy usage, further enhancing overall efficiency. The integration of blockchain technology verifies energy consumption readings and transactions, promoting transparency and trust essential for renewable resource adoption. The approach not only stabilizes grid operations but also fosters the reliability and sustainability of energy systems, supporting a robust adoption of renewable energies.
